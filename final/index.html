            <h2>Our Mission</h2>
            <p>Here at Flying Fox Foundation, our goal is to protect the Mauritian flying fox from eradication by the government of the island of Mauritius. This important seed distributer has been repeatedly culled, killing over 50,000 bats leaving likely fewr that 30,000 on the island. With comunity outreach programs and petitions we hope to stop these mass cullings and save this endangered bat before it is completely gone.</p>

            <h2>What's Going On</h2>
            <img src="images/flying_fox.png" alt="Flying Fox">
            <p>According to National Geographic, The island of Mauritius has killed more than 50,000 flying foxes that once thrived on the small island. Government officials claim they are protecting the fruit growers crops despite the fact the bats account for only 9 to 11% of damage to the fruit trees. The bigger problem? Wastefull growers who allow the fruits to overripen as well as other pests like insects. Despite this, the local fruit bat population is down to an estimated 30,000 bats. </p>
                <p>These bats do very little harm, and yet they are being actively killed in the same place where the famous dodo bird met its end. Without the bats the island will have no more native animals of the island capable of natural seed spreading as other native animals including two other fruit bat species are already gone. </p>
                <p>Without our help the island may order another culling of these bats, leading them ever closer to extinction.</p>
